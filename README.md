* `_config.yml`: change site title, name
* `_includes/EDIT.navbar.html`: what links are placed into the navbar
* `_includes/EDIT.footer.text.md`: text placed in the site footer (markdown)
* `_includes/EDIT.disqus.html`: to enable disqus commenting, edit this to include your disqus shortname. Also, in any post you wish to enable comments, set `comments: true` in the frontmatter.
