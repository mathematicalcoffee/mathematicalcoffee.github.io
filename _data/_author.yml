# author template
#-- for all authors, required:
display_name: ~ # Your name as you wish to display it (John Doe)
handle: ~  # necessary since jekyll-github seems not to support the handleize filter.
           # Use `rake handleize['John Smith']` to get it, or
           #  if you use rake add_author it will be done for you
#-- recommended:
email: ~
web: ~
gravatar: ~ # gravatar hash (md5 of your email address)
bio: ~ # A quick one-sentence bio about me.
# optional: your usernames on these (so people can find you)
