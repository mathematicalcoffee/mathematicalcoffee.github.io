After I watched the first Despicable Me, I decided to try make one of the minions for my sister. Now that the second Despicable Me has come out I've been reminded to post my pattern.

At the time I was very much into making tiny little toys, so this pattern is specifically for a small minion - I used 4ply-equivalent cotton to make this minion and he stands 3 - 4cm tall when done. Since he's small (you not only make him in thinner yarn, he has less stitches in him), he relies on a fair bit of embroidery to get all of his features (face, arms, feet,...) as opposed to crochet. I.e., he is made smaller at the expense of detail (he might not look any good in wool or anything big).

If you wish to make a bigger minion or one with more detail/crochet in it, I recommend one of the [many patterns](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/search#craft=crochet&query=minion&view=captioned_thumbs&sort=best&pc=toysandhobbies) out on the net (ravelry is a nice way to collect them all, though they are not all hosted on ravelry). In particular, I like [this one from crochet-goods](https://sites.google.com/site/crochetgoods/home/minion). My pattern is based on this one, just with a greatly reduced number of stitches.

| slightly too happy minion | back of minion |

(I was going for "very happy" with the expression but I overshot a little and now he looks like a "special" minion :P)  
3-4cm tall (4ply cotton).  
Work it in the round without joining.

**Body (yellow)**  
R1: 6sc in magic ring. (6)  
R2: inc (2sc in ea sc) around (12)  
R3: \*inc, sc\* around (18)  
R4-R12: sc around (18)  
[add extra rows if you want a taller minion]  
R13: \*sc, dec\* around (12). Stuff.  
R14: dec around (6)  
Finish off.

**Overalls (blue)**  
R1: 6sc in magic ring (6)  
R2: inc around (12)  
R3: \*inc, inc, sc\* around (20)  
R4-R5: sc around (20)  
[add extra rows if you have a taller minion]  
R6 - 8: 5sc, ch1, turn [this is worked back and forth, not in the round, to make the front of the overalls].

**Assembly**  
Put the overalls on the minion.  
Using the blue/overall yarn, sl st into one corner of the overall front panel.  
Do a set of chain stitches to be the overall strap and attach to the back.  
Repeat on the other side.

**Finishing**  
Embroider a goofy expression onto the minion (but not as goofy as the one I did!).  
Stick some small googly eyes on and embroider on the goggles strap and goggles frames (I used silver wire for my goggles frames).  
Make the arms using a strand of yarn with a bead on the end.  
Use big beads to make the feet.  
Embroider the black and blue "G" logo on the front of the overalls and you're done!
